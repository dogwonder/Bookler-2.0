### Ingredients

* Â¼ cup tahini
* 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
* 1 tbsp grape seed, canola, or some other neutral oil
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp water
* 1 clove of garlic, crushed
* 1 tsp maple syrup
* 1 tsp minced onion

### Method

1. Measure out the tahini, taking care to mix it first, scraping the bottom to get all the good stuff that might have settled down there. Add the tahini to the blender, along with the remaining ingredients, and blend until completely smooth, scraping down the sides once. 
2. Pour into a container, cover, and let rest for an hour before using so the garlic can fully permeate the dressing (it really intensifies).
