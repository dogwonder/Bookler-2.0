### Ingredients
* 27g (1 cup) dried árbol chilies, stems removed

* 3⁄4 tsp (2g) freshly ground black pepper
* 3 pieces whole star anise
* 2 red or black cardamom pods, split in half
* 2 tsp (6g) freshly ground cumin
* 3 tbsp (28g) freshly ground Sichuan peppercorn
* 3 tbsp (12g) porcini or shiitake mushroom powder
* 5 tsp (30g) kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same by weight
* 2 tbsp (20g) sugar
* 2 ½ cups (500g) peanut oil, or any other neutral oil

* 3⁄4 cup (65g) thinly sliced garlic (about 1mm thick)

### Method

1. Put on disposable latex gloves.
2. Place a wire rack inside a quarter- or half-sheet tray. Using your hands and kitchen shears, cut open chilies and place them on rack. Shake rack to sift off most of the seeds (don’t worry about removing all the seeds). Transfer chilies to a bowl and discard seeds.
3. Using a spice grinder and working in batches, process chilies until they are ground to a size just larger than standard chilli flakes. Transfer processed chilies to a heatproof bowl or pot large enough to accommodate bubbling oil (at least 4 quarts in size). Combine chilli flakes with peanuts, ginger, black pepper, star anise, cardamom, cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, mushroom powder, salt, MSG (if using), and sugar. Set aside.
4. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a 2-quart heatproof bowl. In a 4-quart saucepan, combine oil and shallots. Cook over high heat while constantly stirring. Once shallots become light golden brown, strain. Pour oil back into pot and add garlic. Cook over medium-low heat, constantly stirring, until light golden brown, then strain. Return oil to pot once more. Set aside fried shallots and garlic.
5. Heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Pour hot oil over chilies, spices, and other seasonings. Stir well to distribute hot oil throughout. Set aside to fully cool, about 30 minutes or until bowl or pot is cool to the touch.
6. Once chilli-and-oil mixture has fully cooled, remove star anise and cardamom pods. Mix in fried shallots and garlic. Pour finished chilli crisp into jars and store in the fridge for about 3 months. It can be served immediately, but for best flavour, eat it the next day. Stir well before serving.
