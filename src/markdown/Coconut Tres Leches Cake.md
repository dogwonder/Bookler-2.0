### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut or coconut flakes
* 3 13.5 ounce cans full-fat coconut milk or coconut cream 
* 1 7 ounce can sweetened condensed coconut milk
* 2 heaping cups (285 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon table salt
* 1/2 cup neutral cooking oil, melted coconut oil, or a mix
* 1 tablespoon white or apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* Prepared coconut whipped cream or frozen whipped topping, to serve

### Method

1. Heat your oven to 325ºF and spread the coconut on a baking sheet. Toast in the oven until golden brown, 5 minutes or so, then set aside to cool. Keep an eye on them, because they’ll burn quickly. Transfer to an airtight container.
