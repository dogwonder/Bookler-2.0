### Ingredients 

* Garlic (3 - 5 cloves per person)
* Red chilli - Scotch bonnet
* Olive Oil
* Spaghetti (500g)

### Method

1. Start with just a little extra virgin olive oil in a sauté pan and put in your sliced garlic while the oil is still cold. Raise the temperature slowly and just before the garlic starts to fry, pull the pan off the heat, add a little more cold oil, then put it back on the heat. Keep doing this several times, adding a little more of the cold oil each time, so that you keep the temperature down and the garlic is not frying, but just infusing the maximum amount of its flavour into the oil before you put in the chilli.
2. Cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water, and slice your chilli (around a tbspful, or more if you prefer) and around 4 cloves of garlic about a millimetre thick.
3. You need around 200ml of good extra virgin olive oil, but start with a little of it, cold, in the pan. Put in your garlic, then keep taking the pan off the heat and adding a little more cold oil, then returning it to the heat so that you don’t burn the garlic.
4. Once all the oil is in, you can let the garlic begin to take on a little bit of colour and put in your chopped chilli. Let it cook very briefly, stirring it into the garlic, then pull the pan from the heat and stir in a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta – take care, as it may spit.
5. When the pasta is cooked but still al dente, lift it out and drain it, but keep back the cooking water.
6. Toss the pasta really well through the oil, garlic and chilli, adding a little more cooking water from the pasta if it is too dry, as you want the garlicky hot oil to really cling to the spaghetti, and serve straight away. If you like, you can toss through a tbsp of chopped fresh parsley and finish with some grated parmesan or pecorino.
