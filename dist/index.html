  <h1><a id="6">Aglio olio e peperoncino</a></h1>


  <div>
    <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Garlic </li>
<li>Red chilli </li>
<li>Olive Oil</li>
<li>Spaghetti </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Don’t be scared to add three, four or five sliced cloves of garlic per person, and don’t be shy with the chilli either; I would use a Scotch bonnet, seeds and all, but how hot you make it is up to you. Chillies in red and green are nice, too.</li>
<li>The real trick to this is to start with just a little extra virgin olive oil in a sauté pan and put in your sliced garlic while the oil is still cold. Raise the temperature slowly and just before the garlic starts to fry, pull the pan off the heat, add a little more cold oil, then put it back on the heat. Keep doing this several times, adding a little more of the cold oil each time, so that you keep the temperature down and the garlic is not frying, but just infusing the maximum amount of its flavour into the oil before you put in the chilli.</li>
<li>Start cooking 500g of spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water, and slice your chilli (around a tablespoonful, or more if you prefer) and around 4 cloves of garlic about a millimetre thick.</li>
<li>You need around 200ml of good extra virgin olive oil, but start with a little of it, cold, in the pan. Put in your garlic, then keep taking the pan off the heat and adding a little more cold oil, then returning it to the heat so that you don’t burn the garlic.</li>
<li>Once all the oil is in, you can let the garlic begin to take on a little bit of colour and put in your chopped chilli. Let it cook very briefly, stirring it into the garlic, then pull the pan from the heat and stir in a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta – take care, as it may spit.</li>
<li>When the pasta is cooked but still al dente, lift it out and drain it, but keep back the cooking water.</li>
<li>Toss the pasta really well through the oil, garlic and chilli, adding a little more cooking water from the pasta if it is too dry, as you want the garlicky hot oil to really cling to the spaghetti, and serve straight away. If you like, you can toss through a tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley and finish with some grated parmesan or pecorino.</li>

  <h1><a id="7">Puttanesca</a></h1>


  <div>
    <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 tbsp olive oil </li>
<li>200g/7oz frozen chopped onions  (or 2 medium onions, roughly chopped)</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
<li>125g/4½oz drained, pitted black olives, cut in half</li>
<li>2 tbsp capers  (from a jar), drained</li>
<li>1 tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
<li>½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
<li>400g Passata </li>
<li>150ml/5fl oz red wine or vegetable stock</li>
<li>300g/10½oz dried spaghetti</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>handful fresh flatleaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large, non-stick saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and fry gently for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened and very lightly browned. </li>
<li>Stir in the olives, capers, chilli flakes and salt, then add the tinned tomatoes and red wine (or stock). Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Simmer very gently for 40-45 minutes, stirring regularly, until the sauce has thickened. </li>
<li>Once the sauce has been cooking for 30 minutes, half-fill a large saucepan with boiling water. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the packet instructions, until al dente. </li>
<li>When the pasta is cooked to your liking, reserve 3 tablespoons of the cooking water in a bowl, then drain the pasta in a colander and return it to the saucepan.</li>
<li>Add half of the sauce to the cooked spaghetti, then stir in the reserved cooking water. Continue to stir the mixture carefully until the spaghetti is coated in the sauce. Season, to taste, with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
<li>To serve, transfer the spaghetti and sauce to a warmed serving dish, then pour over the remaining sauce. Drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of oil and garnish with the parsley, if using. Serve immediately.</li>

  <h1><a id="10">Green Bean Casserole Recipe</a></h1>


  <div>
    <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 pounds (680g) green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths</li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped</li>
<li>1/2 pound (225g) button or cremini mushrooms, stems trimmed</li>
<li>3 cups (710ml) vegetable stock or low-sodium broth, plus more as needed</li>
<li>One (2-pound; 900g) head cauliflower, cored and cut into medium florets (1 1/2 pounds or 680g after prep)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon (optional)</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>Canola oil or other neutral oil, for frying</li>
<li>1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced into half moons</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fill a large saucepan about halfway with water and bring to a boil. Season generously with salt, then add the green beans and cook until just tender, about 6 minutes. Drain the beans and rinse out the saucepan.</li>
<li>In a food processor, pulse the yellow onion and mushrooms until finely chopped, about 15 pulses. Transfer to a large bowl and rinse out food processor bowl.</li>
<li>In the same saucepan used for the green beans, bring vegetable broth to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the cauliflower. Cover and cook until the cauliflower is very tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. (If the broth seems to be steaming from under the lid, reduce the heat to low. You want to cook the cauliflower while retaining as much liquid as possible.)</li>
<li>Transfer the cauliflower and cooking liquid to the rinsed-out food processor bowl and let cool slightly. Purée the cauliflower until very smooth. (You can also purée the cauliflower using a high-powered blender, if you have one, which will give you the best texture. However, you can achieve a smooth purée if you let a food processor run for a solid minute or more and scrape down the sides occasionally.)</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Rinse out the saucepan again, then dry well. Add olive oil and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and onions and season generously with salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms and onions stop releasing water and are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the cauliflower sauce, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, thyme, and lemon zest (if using) and season with salt and pepper. (Don’t be shy with the salt and pepper!) Stir in the green beans. If the sauce seems too thick, add more broth until you reach a consistency you like. Transfer the green beans and sauce to a 2-quart baking dish.</li>
<li>Bake the casserole until hot and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat 1/2 inch canola oil until the oil is hot enough that it bubbles when you add a piece of red onion. Add half of the sliced red onion and fry, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 9 to 10 minutes. Using tongs or a spider, transfer the onions to a paper towel–lined plate. Season generously with salt. Repeat with remaining red onions. When the onions are cool enough to touch, use your hands to fluff them a bit so they crisp up.</li>
<li>Let casserole cool for about 5 minutes, then top with the onions and serve.</li>

<li>2 cups (200g) thinly sliced shallots (about 1mm thick)</li>
<li>3/4 cup (65g) thinly sliced garlic (about 1mm thick)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Put on disposable latex gloves.</li>
<li>Place a wire rack inside a quarter- or half-sheet tray. Using your hands and kitchen shears, cut open chilies and place them on rack. Shake rack to sift off most of the seeds (don’t worry about removing all the seeds). Transfer chilies to a bowl and discard seeds.</li>
<li>Using a spice grinder and working in batches, process chilies until they are ground to a size just larger than standard chilli flakes. Transfer processed chilies to a heatproof bowl or pot large enough to accommodate bubbling oil (at least 4 quarts in size). Combine chilli flakes with peanuts, ginger, black pepper, star anise, cardamom, cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, mushroom powder, salt, MSG (if using), and sugar. Set aside.</li>
<li>Set a fine-mesh strainer over a 2-quart heatproof bowl. In a 4-quart saucepan, combine oil and shallots. Cook over high heat while constantly stirring. Once shallots become light golden brown, strain. Pour oil back into pot and add garlic. Cook over medium-low heat, constantly stirring, until light golden brown, then strain. Return oil to pot once more. Set aside fried shallots and garlic.</li>
<li>Heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Pour hot oil over chilies, spices, and other seasonings. Stir well to distribute hot oil throughout. Set aside to fully cool, about 30 minutes or until bowl or pot is cool to the touch.</li>
<li>Once chilli-and-oil mixture has fully cooled, remove star anise and cardamom pods. Mix in fried shallots and garlic. Pour finished chilli crisp into jars and store in the fridge for about 3 months. It can be served immediately, but for best flavour, eat it the next day. Stir well before serving.</li>

  <h1><a id="15">Tahini dressing</a></h1>


  <div>
    <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/4 cup tahini</li>
<li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon grape seed, canola, or some other neutral oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon water</li>
<li>1 clove of garlic, crushed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced onion</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Measure out the tahini, taking care to mix it first, scraping the bottom to get all the good stuff that might have settled down there. Add the tahini to the blender, along with the remaining ingredients, and blend until completely smooth, scraping down the sides once. </li>
<li>Pour into a container, cover, and let rest for an hour before using so the garlic can fully permeate the dressing (it really intensifies). </li>
