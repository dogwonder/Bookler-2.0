              <p>The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Developed at <a href="http://gv.com">Google Ventures</a>, it’s a “greatest hits” of business strategy, innovation, behavior science, design thinking, and more — packaged into a battle-tested process that any team can use.</p>
              <p>Working together with companies in a sprint, we shortcut the usual endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, teams get great data from a prototype. The sprint gives these companies a superpower: The ability to build and test nearly any idea in just 40 hours.</p>
              <p>This page is a DIY guide for running your own sprint. On <a href="#monday">Monday</a>, you’ll unpack the problem. On <a href="#tuesday">Tuesday</a>, you’ll sketch competing solutions on paper. On <a href="#wednesday">Wednesday</a>, you’ll argue and decide how to turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis. On <a href="#thursday">Thursday</a>, you’ll hammer out a high-fidelity prototype. And on <a href="#friday">Friday</a>, you’ll test it with real live humans.</p>
